# Covid-19-vs-World-Happiness
The World Happiness Report and COVID-19 data can be correlated using statistical techniques such as correlation analysis. Here are a few potential correlations to investigate:
Examine the association between socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 cases by looking at variables like GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy. This approach can shed light on how social and economic issues affect a nation's capacity to combat the pandemic.
Whether there is a connection between COVID-19 instances (confirmed, recovered, and deaths) and the general happiness rank or score should be looked into.
Freedom and Generosity During the Pandemic: Look into if the World Happiness Report's measures of freedom and generosity are related to COVID-19 instances. This approach can clarify the connection between personal liberties, social support, and the pandemic response.
